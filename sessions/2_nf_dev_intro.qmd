title: "Developing bioinformatics workflows with Nextflow"
---

This workshop is designed to provide participants with a fundamental understanding of developing bioinformatics pipelines using Nextflow. This workshop aims to provide participants with the necessary skills required to create a Nextflow pipeline from scratch or from the nf-core template. 

### Course Presenters

- Song Li, Bioinformatics Core Facility, Peter Mac
- Richard Lupat, Bioinformatics Core Facility, Peter Mac

### Course Helpers

TBC

### Prerequisites

- Experience with command line interface and cluster/slurm
- Familiarity with the basic concept of workflows
- Attendance in the ['Introduction to Nextflow and Running nf-core Workflows'](./1_intro_run_nf.qmd) workshop, or an understanding of the Nextflow concepts outlined in the workshop material 

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:

- Develop a basic Nextflow workflow consisting of processes that use multiple scripting languages
- Read data of different types into a Nextflow workflow
- Output Nextflow process results to a predefined directory
- Re-use and import processes, modules, and sub-workflows into a Nextflow workflow
- Gain an understanding of Nextflow channel operators 
- Develop a basic Nextflow workflow with nf-core templates 
- Troubleshoot known errors in workflow development
